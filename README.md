ðŸ¦ˆ An unofficial python client for digitalocean postgres clusters (5+ integrations).

Uses [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) and [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) to create beautiful command line interactions for postgres databases. 

## setup (<3 minutes)
First, install python3 and doctl [using homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
```
brew install python3, doctl
```
Next, install python dependencies within a virtual environment
```
git clone 
cd 
virtualenv env 
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Next, you can setup the cli (you will need your api key and must have already created a managed database postgres instance).
```
python3 cli.py
```
After this, you will see ```settings.json``` and ```databases.json``` in your dopg_cli directory that will be used to configure all the commands that follow. 

## commands 
There are 3 main ways to use the DOpg CLI client, sectioned out below.

### query databases
Connects with BSD-licensed [pgcli](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli), a really nice interface to connect to postgres and query postgres databases.

### doctl commands
[doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) is the python command line interface.

More on doctl database docs here.

You can also get doctl docs using (pulls up doctl and api docs).
```
python3 cli.py --command docs
```

### api commands
[The DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Databases) is a great way to get json responses from common routes related to databases.

You can also get doctl docs using (pulls up doctl and api docs).
```
python3 cli.py --command docs
```

### pricing
You can get pricing of managed databases within digitalocean using public links:
```
python3 cli.py --command pricing
```

### test 
You can do some smoke tests on newly created databases with the following command:
```
python3 cli.py --command tests
```

This command opens up a postgres cluster, inserts a users schema, and inserts a few pieces of data, reads this data, then deletes this data and schema. If tests passed they will be shown using the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) in python.
